## Task 1:
Organisations use machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify customer segments for targeted marketing strategies. Understanding how SVM works and its application in real-world scenarios is crucial for effective customer segmentation.

You are tasked with analysing a dataset containing customer information and building a classification model using SVM techniques. The dataset includes numerical and categorical features such as:

- Age
- Income
- Spending Score
- Region
- Customer Category (Target) (High value or low value customer)

Your objective: Develop a machine learning model with high accuracy and precision.

Dataset: Customer Segmentation Data

Tool to be used: Python

## Questions:
1. How do support vectors impact the decision boundary in SVM? Which feature has the strongest influence on customer segmentation?
2. If the margin width is large, what does it imply about classification confidence? If the data requires a non-linear kernel, what might that suggest about the dataset? If support vectors change significantly when retrained, what does that imply about model stability?
