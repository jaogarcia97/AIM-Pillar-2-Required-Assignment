## Task 2

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, such as T-shirts, sneakers, and coats. You are tasked with developing a CNN model to classify the clothing items into their respective categories.

- The Fashion MNIST dataset is an in-built dataset from Keras.
- Use the following code to import the dataset from keras.datasets

Tool: Python + TensorFlow / Keras

# Questions:

- How do convolutional filters influence feature extraction in a CNN model? Which layer contributes the most to accurate clothing classification?
- If the training accuracy is high but validation accuracy is low, what does it imply about model generalization? If increasing epochs leads to worse validation performance, what could be happening? If test accuracy fluctuates significantly with retraining, what does that say about model robustness?
