## Task 3:
Organisations rely on predictive analytics to determine fair and competitive salaries based on employee attributes. Machine learning models help identify salary trends and ensure data-driven compensation decisions.

You are tasked with analysing a dataset containing employee information and building a predictive model using regression techniques. The dataset includes numerical and categorical features such as:

- Experience
- Education
- Age
- Location
- Role
- Salary (Target)

Your objective is to develop a machine learning model with good R2.

Tool to be used: Python

Dataset: employee_salary_dataset.csv

## Questions

1. Feature Influence: What does a positive or negative coefficient indicate for each variable? Which feature has the strongest influence on salary?

2. Practical Implications: If the coefficient for Experience is positive, what does it imply? If Location has a significant effect on salary, what could be the reason? If Education has a high p-value, what does that suggest about its impact?
