## Task 2:

Employee attrition is a major concern for organisations as retaining skilled employees is crucial for business success. Predicting whether an employee will leave the company can help HR departments take proactive measures.

You are tasked with analysing an HR dataset and building a predictive model using logistic regression. The dataset includes various features with Attrition (Target: Yes = Left, No = Stayed)

Your objective is to develop an accurate model to predict employee attrition and provide actionable insights for HR management.

Dataset: hr_dataset.csv


## Questions 

1. What does a positive or negative coefficient indicate for each variable? Which feature has the strongest influence on employee attrition? In a logistic regression model, the coefficient values indicate the direction and magnitude of the relationship between each independent variable and the target variable (Attrition). For example, if Years at Company has a negative coefficient, it suggests that employees with longer tenure are less likely to leave. Identify which variable has the largest positive or negative impact on attrition and discuss why.

2. Discuss practical implications: If the coefficient for Work-Life Balance is negative, what does it imply about its impact on attrition? If Overtime has a high positive coefficient, what does it suggest about its influence on employee retention? If Salary Level has a small or non-significant coefficient, what could be the reason?
