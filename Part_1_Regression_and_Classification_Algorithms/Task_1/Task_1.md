## Task 1:
The real estate industry heavily relies on predictive analytics to estimate housing prices based on various factors such as location, property size, age, and amenities. Machine learning models help in understanding these patterns and making data-driven decisions.

You are tasked with analysing a dataset of housing prices and building a predictive model using regression techniques. The dataset includes numerical features such as:

- Square_Feet
- Num_Bedrooms
- Num_Bathrooms
- Age_of_House
- House_Price(Target)

Tool to be used: Python
Dataset: housing_prices.xlsx

Questions:
1. If the coefficient for Square_Feet is significantly positive, what could be the reason?
2. Discuss practical implications: After building your regression model, plot the residual plot for your selected predictor variable. What does the residual plot reveal about the linearity assumption of your model? Explain whether your model shows signs of non-linearity and how you would address it if present.
